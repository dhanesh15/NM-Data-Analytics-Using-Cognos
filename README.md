## Project Description
The project involves using IBM Cognos to predict customer churn and identify factors influencing customer retention. The goal is to help businesses reduce customer attrition by understanding the patterns and reasons behind customers leaving. This project includes defining analysis objectives, collecting customer data, designing relevant visualizations in IBM Cognos, and building a predictive model.

# Phase 1
In this phase, analysis objectives, data collection methods, visualization strategy and description about predictive modelling techniques were clearly defined.

# Phase 2
In this phase, method of approach and flow of working was decided. Brief description various benefits of the chosen approach were documented.
**Method of approach: Using of Ensembled Models**

# Phase 3
Primary phase 3 objective is to clean the given dataset and preprocess to perfrom various analysis.
Duplicates and Nulls were removed. Unwanted and redundant rows and columns were removed from the dataset. All categorical values were converted to binary / numerical values. Some of the categorical based visualizations were also performed.

# Phase 4
This phase mainly focuses on different analysis, model building and evaluation based on the requirement.
Various models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost were compared and used to predict the most important category affect the churn rate. Based on the results, various graphs were plotted using IBM Cognos.

# Phase 5
Final phase of this project is to continue building the model.
Class imbalances were reduced using SMOTE analysis. 
RFE is used for feature selection.
Model ensembling is carried out using a voting classifier (Models: XGBoost and Random Forest)
